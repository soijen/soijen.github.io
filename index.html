      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        We draw our inspiration from the Selk’nam – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The Selk’nam were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscape and harsh climates at the end of the world. Occasionally during their wanderings the Selk’nam crossed paths with other travelling hunters. To celebrate the meeting they organized footraces called káiyik, where runners sprinted around lakes or raced to the top of hills. The winner of the káiyik was the sóijen – or champion runner.<br><br>

        Although we are far from champion runners, and hardly come close to winning a modern-day káiyik, running defines a big part of our identity. The hours we spend running the trails – training, exploring, conquering new peaks – is when we feel the most at home. It makes us question, how we can live a life more integrated with the outdoors?<br><br>

        Sóijen is about our search for the best trails, our organized wanderings, and our journey towards a simpler life.<br><br>
