  <h2>About Sóijen</h2>
  <p>At Sóijen, we are first and foremost outdoor adventurers with a passion for the wind-swept peaks and icy fjords of southern Patagonia. We create designs that inspire fellow adventurers to get out and explore off-the-beaten-path areas in Patagonia and beyond.</p>
  <p>Our products are made with recycled materials and partnerships with environmentally-conscience vendors. We support and collaborate with local agencies and environmental initiatives to preserve and protect this one-of-a-kind region.</p>
  <h3>What does <em>Sóijen</em> mean?</h3>
  <p>We drew inspiration for our name from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p>

  <h2>Sustainability & Materials</h2>
    <p>At Sóijen we are commited to sustainability. We collaborate with environmentally conscience suppliers and maximize the recycled content in all our product materials and packaging. At least 1% of each purchase is donated to environmental non-profits and initiatives in Chile.</p>
  <h3>Our tote bags</h3>
    <p>The fabric for our tote bags is a blend of 65% recycled cotton and 35% recycled post consumer poly. The recycled cotton is recuperated from fabric waste generated during the manufacturing process of new clothes, traditionally sent to landfills. The recycled poly is derived from 100% recycled PET plastic bottles.</p>
  <h3>Our posters & paper products</h3>
    <p>All of our posters and paper products are printed with soy based inks, on paper that is 100% recycled, post-consumer waste, as well as certified FSC (responsible forestry), Ecologo, Chlorine Free, Bio Gas Energy and Ancient Forest Friendly.</p>

  <h3>Get Inspired. Go Outside. & Give Back.</h3>
    <p>Support the wild places you love. Each year we donate a percentage of our profits to support environmental initiatives in Chile. In 2018 and 2019 we partnered with Fundación Reforestemos, a non profit dedicated to recovering degraded ecosystems in Patagonia and other areas in Chile.</p>
    <p>Donations are used to plant native trees in regions with high ecological value throughout Patagonia and Chile.
