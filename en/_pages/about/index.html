      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <p>We are Eduardo Donoso & Jess Young - co-owners and co-adventurers of Soijen. We started Soijen as a way to create designs that celebrate the natural beauty of Chilean Patagonia, our original home. Since moving to Vermont, our new playground in the Green Mountains has inspired us to continue creating outdoor-focused designs and gifts, to motivate fellow adventurers to get out and explore Patagonia, New England and beyond. At the core of all our products are <a href="/about/sustainability" title="Soijen Sustainability">sustainably sourced materials</a>, and through partnerships with environmental non-profits we give back to the wild places we love.</p>

  <h3>Where does <em>Soijen</em> come from?</h3>
  <p>We drew inspiration for our name from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p>
