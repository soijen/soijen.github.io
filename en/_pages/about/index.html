  <p>Welcome! We are Eduardo & Jess - co-owners and co-adventurers of Soijen. We started Soijen as a way to celebrate our passion for the wind-swept peaks and icy fjords of southern Chilean Patagonia, our original home. Since moving to Vermont, our new playground in the Green Mountains has inspired us to continue creating outdoor-focused designs and gifts, to motivate fellow outdoor enthusiasts to get out and explore Patagonia, New England and beyond.</p>
  <p>Our products are made with recycled materials and partnerships with environmentally-conscious vendors. At least 1% of each purchase is donated to environmental non-profits and initiatives in Chile.</p>
  <h3>Where does <em>Soijen</em> come from?</h3>
  <p>We drew inspiration for our name from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p>
