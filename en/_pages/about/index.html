      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! We are Eduardo & Jess, the creative duo behind Soijen. Through a mix of illustration techniques we create fun and bright designs that celebrate outdoor adventure and wanderlust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soijen was born in 2019 in Chilean Patagonia, when we started creating map illustrations of our favorite off-the-beaten-path spots that we explored in our camper van.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of our eclectic design inspirations and themes include: our favorite mountain peaks and ridgelines, minimalism, color pops, epic road trips, and all things <em>kawaii</em>. We now split our time between Vermont and Chilean Patagonia and you can find our products in shops across the US and Chile, online, and at many many many <a href="/about/events" title="Soijen Event Schedule">in-person events</a> throughout the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        To give back to the wild places we love, we donate at least 1% of our sales to organizations dedicated to environmental conservation. We are proud to use <a href="/about/sustainability" title="Soijen Sustainability">recycled and responsibly sourced materials</a> to create our products.

  <h3>Where does <em>Soijen</em> come from?</h3>
  <p>We drew inspiration for our name from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p>
