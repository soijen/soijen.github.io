    <p>At Soijen we are committed to sustainability. We collaborate with environmentally conscious suppliers and maximize the recycled content in all our product materials and packaging. At least 1% of each purchase is donated to environmental non-profits and initiatives in Chile.</p>

  <h2>Materials</h2>
  <h3>Our tote bags and pouches</h3>
    <p>The fabric for our tote bags is a blend of 65% recycled cotton and 35% recycled post consumer poly. The recycled cotton is recuperated from fabric waste generated during the manufacturing process of new clothes, traditionally sent to landfills. The recycled poly is derived from 100% recycled PET plastic bottles. All our tote bags are made in USA.</p>
  <h3>Our posters & paper products</h3>
    <p>All of our posters and paper products are printed on paper that maximizes recycled content and post-consumer waste, and with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification and/or Green Seal certification. Check out our <a href="/paper-sustainability" title="Celebrating International Day of Forests with... paper?">blog post on sustainably sourcing paper</a> for more information.</p>
  <h3>Packaging</h3>
    <p>Most of our packaging is plastic-free, and consists of recycled kraft paper or other recycled paper products. Our art prints are protected by an Eco Clear plant-based PLA sleeve that is certified compostable.</p>
