  <h2>Materials</h2>
  <h3>Our paper goods</h3>
    <p>All of our prints and paper goods are printed on paper that maximizes recycled content and post-consumer waste, and with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification and/or Green Seal certification. The cardstock for our prints and greeting cards comes from a paper mill powered 100% by wind energy. All of our prints, stationery and other paper goods are printed by us in our studio in Vermont.</p>
  <h3>Our tote bags and pouches</h3>
    <p>The fabric for our tote bags is a blend of 65% recycled cotton and 35% recycled post consumer poly. The recycled cotton is recuperated from fabric waste generated during the manufacturing process of new clothes, traditionally sent to landfills. The recycled poly is derived from 100% recycled PET plastic bottles. All our tote bags are Made in USA.</p>
  <h3>Packaging</h3>
    <p>Most of our packaging is plastic-free, and consists of recycled kraft paper or other recycled paper products. Our art prints are protected by an Eco Clear plant-based PLA sleeve that is certified compostable.</p>
