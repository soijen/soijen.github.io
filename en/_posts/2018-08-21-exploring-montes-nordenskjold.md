Southern Tierra del Fuego - on the Chile side - is largely untouched and with very little infrastructure. Not having options of developed trails, we decided to park our van where possible and make an impromptu trek up some of the mountains right off of the main road.

<h2>Background</h2>
- <strong>Trek:</strong> Out-and-back, off-trail from Rt Y-85 up the Nordenskjold Mountains.
- <strong>Total Distance:</strong> 10 km
- <strong>Location:</strong> Tierra del Fuego between Lago Fagnano and Caleta María (see <a href="#map">map</a> below)
- <strong>Closest City:</strong> Pampa Guanaco, Chile

<h2>Route Description</h2>
We parked at a small pull-off next to a stream, on the south side of the road between Caleta María and Lago Fagnano. There's no formal path but we followed guanaco trails when we could through the spongy turba and low vegetation. As we ascended from the valley there were a couple of stream/river crossings. Although most were manageable, one required we hike upstream to find a safe place to cross. The small bushes and trees dropped off pretty quickly and before long we were scaling up a rocky slope, exposed to the elements. The steep ascent was rewarded with panoramic views of Caleta María and the surrounding mountains, as well as some leftover snow to play in.
