  <h1 class="callout-title">About Us</h1>
  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>We draw our inspiration from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscapes at the end of the world. When they crossed paths, they celebrated with unique footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, sprinting around lakes or racing to the tops of hills. The winner was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.</p></br>
    <p>The hours we spend running the trails – training, exploring, conquering new peaks – is a big part of our identity. It’s when we feel the most at home.</p></br>
