    <p>
        We draw our inspiration from the <em>Selk’nam</em> – the indigenous people of southern Patagonia. The <em>Selk’nam</em> were nomadic hunters, traveling by foot across the desolate landscape and harsh climates at the end of the world. Occasionally during their wanderings the <em>Selk’nam</em> crossed paths with other travelling hunters. To celebrate the meeting they organized footraces called <em>káiyik</em>, where runners sprinted around lakes or raced to the top of hills. The winner of the <em>káiyik</em> was the <em>sóijen</em> – or champion runner.<br><br>

        Although we are far from champion runners, and hardly come close to winning a modern-day <em>káiyik</em>, running defines a big part of our identity. The hours we spend running the trails – training, exploring, conquering new peaks – is when we feel the most at home. It makes us question, how we can live a life more integrated with the outdoors?<br><br>

        <em>Sóijen</em> is about our search for the best trails, our organized wanderings, and our journey towards a simpler life.<br><br>
