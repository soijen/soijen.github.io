If you want to experience the end of the world – surrounded by the southernmost channels and fjords before Antarctic waters, backpacking or trail running the remote trails, or simply escaping the craziness of everyday life – Puerto Williams is your next destination.

<h2>Background</h2>

Put your finger on a map and move it to the south of South America. Stop! Right there before Cape Horn. There is an island called “Navarino”. On the southern side of the Beagle Channel, you can find the Chilean town of Puerto Williams.

Isla Navarino was the home of the native people “Yagán” or “Yamana”. They were hunters and nomads who sailed in small canoes over channels and fjords. During the 50’s the Chilean government established the town of Puerto Williams with a population of the Chilean Navy and their families. Now Puerto Williams has a population around 2874 habitants.

<h2>How to Arrive</h2>

You only have two options: by air or by the sea.

If you have time I definitely suggest the trip by sea. From Punta Arenas sail in a small ferry through the channels around Tierra del Fuego, passing various glaciers. After 30 hours you arrive in Puerto Williams.

If you don’t have time you can take an airplane from Punta Arenas. On a clear day, you have great views of the surrounding mountains, channels, and glaciers during the flight. The flight time is around 40 minutes, but it is weather dependent and can sometimes take an hour and a half. You can walk to the town from the airport (5K) or you can take a shuttle (2000 CLP).

<h2>The City of Puerto Williams</h2>

In Puerto Williams, you can find everything on a small scale, but without many options. Local business is open from 10 AM to noon and then from 4 PM to around 7 PM. The majority of these places accept USD and credit cards. Bring your reusable shopping bag, plastic bags are ban.

You can walk around the town in less than a half day. But if you want to explore more you can rent a bike or a car.

The internet is not the best but you can go to the Martin Gusinde Museum, where you can find free internet. Although I suggest you get a data plan for your cell phone ahead of time in the city of Punta Arenas.

Definitely, visit the Tourist Information booth downtown to find maps and more information about local activities.

Certainly, Navarino Island has more fun and outdoor activities than can fit in one week. Also, note in Navarino island you will be drinking the <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/119774/20151229/this-is-where-the-worlds-purest-water-can-be-found.htm">world’s purest water</a>.
