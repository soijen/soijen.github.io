This zippered pouch features an adventure dog paddling in a canoe. This sturdy recycled cotton pouch measures 7.5 x 4.25 inches and is a convenient size to fit pens, pencils and other small trinkets.

The design is screen printed on thick recycled cotton canvas fabric. The fabric is a blend of 65% recycled cotton and 35% recycled post consumer poly. The recycled cotton is recuperated from fabric waste generated during the manufacturing process of new clothes, traditionally sent to landfills. The recycled poly is derived from 100% recycled PET plastic bottles.
