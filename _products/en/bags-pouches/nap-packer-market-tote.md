This playful tote bag features an adventurous and sleepy pup taking a nap on top of a backpacking pack with the words "Nap-Packer". This sturdy and spacious tote is perfect for a trip to the farmer's market measuring 18 x 12 inches with a 6 inch wide bottom gusset and a 25 inch black handle.

The colorful design is screen printed on thick recycled cotton canvas fabric. The fabric is a blend of 65% recycled cotton and 35% recycled post consumer poly. The recycled cotton is recuperated from fabric waste generated during the manufacturing process of new clothes, traditionally sent to landfills. The recycled poly is derived from 100% recycled PET plastic bottles.

To give back to the wild places we love, we donate at least 1% of our sales to organizations dedicated to environmental conservation. We are proud use recycled and responsibly sourced materials to create our products. Made in USA.
